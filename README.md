# Flemp3
A simple bash script that converts a library of flac files to mp3s.  

## Usage
Just place `Flemp3.sh` at the root of your music library structure.

Make it executable.
`chmod +x Flemp3.sh`

And run.
`./Flemp3.sh`

Warning:  It is not good procedure to run random bash scripts on the internet.
Look at the script before you run it.  

## ToDo (in no particular order)
- Allow configuration of where converted mp3s are stored
- Mirror library structure in output folder
